# Segmentation of Drone Collision Hazards in Airborne RADAR Point Clouds Using PointNet
arXiv preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03221

In this work we deploy an airborne radar in an M300 drone and train a PointNet architecture to perform semantic segmentation of 5 classes. 

This WIP repository displays relevant parts of code developed. In particular:

- A self-labelling algorithm for automatically labelling targets with high-frequency and accurate GPS positioning.

- A KML mission planning algorithm for sensor performance characterization

- The data processing and PointNet training routines

Sample data files to be included for testing of the pipeline.
